Python <-> Arduino communicate via Serial
Baud Rate: 9600

Python: send Arduino the line
COLLECT <length in seconds>
to turn on Arduino and collect for that length of time

also may send Arduino
INTERRUPT
to turn off the Arduino early. (need to implement)

While the geiger counter is on, the Arduino will send back
COUNT <timestamp>
for each count, the timestamp is a long denoting the number of milliseconds since the Arduino turned on (caveat: resets approx. every 50 days)

Also, at the beginning of collection, the Arduino will send
START <timestamp>
and at the end of collection,
END <timestamp>

To make it easier on the python side of things.
